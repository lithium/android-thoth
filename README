Thoth - Android RSS Reader
==========================

Concept
-------
Simple, elegant RSS reader. That's it. 


Explanation
-----------
We all need something to replace the "Google Reader" android app that will be end-of-lived on July 1, 2013.
Most of the alternatives in the market now rely on Google's reader service that is also being discontiued and/or have really poor outdated UI.
also ads.. blech. not even google reader had those!


Functional Requirements
-----------------------
    - alternative to google reader app for android (closing july 1st)
    - free to use, all features open.
    - name-your-own-price in-app billing (shareware nag dialog)
    - elegant simple UI
    - share intent from android chrome (in chrome, share a page to send it to app so app can scrape it for rss/atom definition)
    - rss2 / atom support
    - no discovery/search.
    - 4.x+ 


Competing apps
--------------
    - rssdemon (6k)
        - starts up populated with random list of feeds.
        - ads
        - extra podcast stuff
        - local search
        - excessive notifications
        - clumsy menu-driven ui
        - import did not preserve folder structure
    - feedly (63k)
        - requires website account
        - requires whole feedly ecosystem
        - "innovative" view/interface is just distracting
    - greader (39k)
        - requires google reader or some other backend service
        - like the sidebar nav ui
        - confusing bottom-nav ui, (check and O?)
        - feed dissapeared when i accidently clicked mark all as read
    - google currents (38k)
        - good "standard" drawer+cards ui
        - no rss folder hierarchy
        - cards are a little confusing because the layout/image switches
        - paging through an article with horizontal swipe is strange
    - pulse news (89k)
        - magazine view
        - slow
        - tablet oriented
    - newsrob (17k)
        - clunky list view
        - google reader required
